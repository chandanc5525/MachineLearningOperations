## Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Project
---

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) workflow using the California Housing Dataset.
It follows a modular and production-oriented structure to ensure scalability, reproducibility, and maintainability across the machine learning lifecycle.
---

## Overview

- The project implements a complete ML pipeline including:

- Data Ingestion – Loading dataset from the source.

- Feature Engineering – Creating additional derived features for better model performance.

- Data Splitting – Dividing data into training and testing subsets.

- Model Training – Training a regression model using Scikit-learn pipelines.

- Evaluation – Assessing model performance using R² and MSE.

- Model Saving – Persisting the trained model as an artifact.

- Configuration Management – Managing parameters through YAML configuration files.
